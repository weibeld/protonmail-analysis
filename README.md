# ProtonMail Security Analysis

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is an email service providing end-to-end encryption for emails between ProtonMail users, as well as between ProtonMail users and other [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://www.openpgp.org/) compatible senders and receivers.

The goal of this repository is to analyse the claimed security of ProtonMail, in particular, the encryption and management of the users' private keys.

## Contents

### Simulation

The [src/](src) directory in this repository contains a Python script that simulates the encryption of a PGP private key as done by ProtonMail.

The goal is that, given the same inputs (unencrypted private key, user password, salts, initialisation vectors), the simulation produces the exact same encrypted private key as ProtonMail.

### Annotated web client

The associated [weibeld/WebClient](https://github.com/weibeld/WebClient) repository is a fork of the official web client of ProtonMail ([ProtonMail/WebClient](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClient)) and contains log outputs that allow to trace the execution of the web client.

Currently, mainly the account creation logic is traced, which contains the creation and encryption of the user's private key.

## Current status

Regarding the Python simulation in [src/](src).

### Parameters

The most important parameters are:

- Private key encryption algorithm: AES-256 CFB mode
- AES-256 CFB initialisation vector: 16 bytes generated randomly and included in the OpenPGP private key packet (see [RFC 4880 ยง5.5.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.5.3))
- S2K hashing algorithm: SHA-256
- S2K usage: 254
- S2K type: iterated
- S2K salt: 8 bytes generated randomly and saved in the OpenPGP private key packet as the "string-to-key specifier" (see [RFC 4880 ยง5.5.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.5.3))

### To do

The most important things left to do are:

- Construct and deconstruct the private key packet as defined in [RFC 4880 ยง5.5.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.5.3)
- Find out how the private key packet is armored: what exactly does the armored representation of the private key packet that is transmitted between the client and the server contain?
