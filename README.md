# ProtonMail Security Analysis

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is an email service providing end-to-end encryption for emails between ProtonMail users as well as between ProtonMail users and other [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://www.openpgp.org/) compatible senders and receivers.

The goal of this repository is to analyse the claimed security of ProtonMail, in particular, the encryption and management of the users' private keys.
